# Mavis Vs. The Devil

A cruel typing game, designed for a physical pop-up

You are Mavis. 
You are in hell.
You must type.

---

# Game Notes
This is a 'roguelike' in that every play is randomly generated. It's more of an arcade typing experience.

The game runs through 5 rounds of typing challenges, each lasting 30 seconds (on a timer!). You can lose.
Every time you lose you descend a level of hell, every time you win you ascend. 
There is no (?) victory, but above the cabinet is a display showing the current level of hell we have reached.

## Modifiers
The game starts easy, a list of common words.
It also secretly starts creating a list of words you have messed up, and your WPM stats and such.

Each round, the devil shows up and gives you a random modifier; and it randomizes the wordlist.

## Wordlists
- cruel and annoying wordlists, like left-hand-only, hyphens, Capitalized Nouns, No home row, long words, and so on.

## Modifiers
non-wordlist elements that make the game harder. Things like:
- No lookahead
- The wordlist moves
- Alternating Visiblility
- Randomly Capitalized Letters
- Failed Presses Added to the end
- Restart Word on Failure
- Restart All on Failure
- Words slowly vanishing in front of you
- More Words
- Repeat Every Word Twice In A Row
- Reversed Capitalization
- Random Letters Added

# Visuals
Top half of the game should be a pixel-art fighting game between Mavis and the Devil, and when you miss a letter, you get punched. When you make a word, you punch. JUICE.
If you ever hit 'backspace', demotivational messages appear on screen. Things like "You Cannot Go Back" and "There Is No Escape" and such.
